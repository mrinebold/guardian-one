## Daily Cost Tracking Log

### November 14, 2025 (Day 1)

| Time | Agent | Task | Tokens Used | Cost |
|------|-------|------|-------------|------|
| 09:00-12:00 | Helio | SaladBar workflow setup | 45,000 | $135 |
| 12:00-15:00 | Nova | PRD writing (research, competitive analysis) | 85,000 | $255 |
| 15:00-17:00 | Helio | Database migration creation | 20,000 | $60 |
| 17:00-20:00 | Nova | Technical + user documentation | 52,000 | $156 |
| **Daily Total** | - | - | **202,000** | **$606** |

**Note:** Token costs based on Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing ($15/1M input tokens, $75/1M output tokens, ~50% input/output split)

## Cost Control Measures

### Budget Safeguards
1. **Daily Limit:** $2,000/day (alert if exceeded)
2. **Milestone Cap:** Each milestone has hard cost limit
3. **Weekly Review:** Helio reviews costs every Friday, adjusts agent allocation
4. **Dustin Approval:** Any overage >10% requires Ken/Dustin sign-off

### Cost Optimization Tactics
1. **Model Selection:** Use Haiku ($0.25-1.25/M tokens) for simple tasks (docs, tests)
2. **Context Management:** Agents maintain conversation history to avoid re-prompting
3. **Parallel Work:** Multiple agents work simultaneously (faster = cheaper)
4. **Reusable Code:** Agents reference existing patterns vs rewriting from scratch

### Red Flags (Escalate to Ken)
- [ ] Single agent exceeds $5,000 budget
- [ ] Total cost hits $70,000 before Day 60
- [ ] Any agent requires >100 hours for single milestone
- [ ] Cost per feature >$1,000 (inefficiency indicator)

## Transparency for Dustin

**Why This Matters:**
- Dustin is skeptical of AI → Show exact costs, no hidden expenses
- Proves AI agents are FAST (90 days) and CHEAP ($88k vs $496k)
- Every dollar tracked = credibility

**Weekly Cost Email to Dustin:**
- Every Monday at 9 AM (with milestone progress email)
- Summary: Agents used, hours logged, cost this week
- Comparison: "Traditional team would have spent $X more"
- ROI update: "At this pace, breakeven at 110 users ($10,890 revenue)"
